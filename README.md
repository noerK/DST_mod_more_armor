### A don't starve together mod

Adds Stone&Bone to the Log Suit. 

The original idea was just to provide some additional recipies to avoid carrying 3-4 Log Suits.

Now you can upgrade the durability of your Log Suit with Rocks and Bones (which are way more valuable than wood and grass)

I added some configuration options, where you could also change the amount of ingredients needed, durability and block-value if you want to.

Default values:

Stone Suit: 
 - Block: 80%
 - Durability: Log Suit's Durability * 2.5 
 - Ingredients: 6 Rocks, 2 Rope, 1 Log Suit

Bone Suit: 
 - Block: 80%
 - Durability: Log Suit's Durability * 5 
 - Ingredients: 6 Bone Shards, 2 Rope, 1 Stone Suit

Now supports Armor Repair Kit (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1155672829) -> thnx to Amnesiac (https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056767469) for providing the needed information.

I hope you like it. If you got any ideas or encounter any bugs, please let me know :)
